    "\n",
    "Our research topic is Pedestrian Trajectories Prediction.This prediction can be affected by many factors, such as agent's destionation, the social group the agent is in(eg. the agent is a couple), the social scene and the social interation. In our research, we focus on predicting the trajectories by training a model on the trajectories history data and use the model to predict future trajectories. We have chosen this topic, because the trajectories prediction has been widely applied in many modern industries. From service robots to automatic driving, trajectories prediction plays quite important role.   "

    "\n",
    "Our research goal is: how many factor variations can we obtain from the dataset? We can make a bold speculation based on instinct, the factors could be social interations, destinations and scene. "
