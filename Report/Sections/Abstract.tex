Pedestrians trajectory prediction has received significant importance over the last few years due to the increase in autonomous robots and vehicles, specifically in the automotive industry because of the rising number of self-driving vehicles. Different methods can be used to accomplish the trajectory prediction task. In recent years, GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) have been applied to trajectory prediction because of their good multimodal performance. However, GANs also introduce a latent space, which is completely unknown and uncontrollable. In this report, we tried to overcome this problem by InfoGAN (an information-theoretic extension of Generative Adversarial Network). Our InfoGAN implementation attempts to learn a disentangled representation of plausible future trajectories in a completely unsupervised manner. In addition, we added a regularization to constrain that changes in different codes should be uncorrelated and disentangled a factor that can move the trajectory upwards/downwards.
