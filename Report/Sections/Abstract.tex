Pedestrians trajectory prediction has received significant importance over the last few years due to the increase in autonomous robots and vehicles, specifically in the automotive industry because of the rising number of self-driving vehicles. Different methods can be used to accomplish the trajectory prediction task, however deterministic and non-deterministic methods are the most commonly used methods. In this report, we used the non-deterministic method, for trajectory prediction and tried to overcome this problem by using sequence prediction and InfoGAN (an information-theoretic extension of Generative Adversarial Network): our recurrent sequence-to-sequence model observes the small subset of pedestrian trajectory as history and predicts the future trajectory, to predict it uses a pooling mechanism to aggregate the information across the other nearby trajectories in the dataset. Our InfoGAN implementation for trajectory prediction learns and predicts disentangled representations of plausible future trajectories in a completely unsupervised manner. We show through experiments, that our proposed method generates more diverse trajectories with disentangled representations.
