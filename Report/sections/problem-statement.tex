Predicting human trajectory is a complex task, human can completely alter their path depending on varying situations (i.e: surroundings, crowded environment, social gathering).\newline
We intend to predict multiple the human trajectories by varying the situation for a given starting point by observing it for some seconds and then predicting the next few seconds.
