As humans, we make effective predictions of pedestrian trajectories over long time horizons even when novel behavior is present \cite[]{diidha}, and continually estimate peopleâ€™s underlying goals or intent from subtle motion \cite[]{doi:10.1146/annurev.psych.57.102904.190152}. If robots are to similarly navigate and interact safely with people, reliable forecasts of human behavior are required \cite[]{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1905-06113}. For long-term prediction of pedestrian trajectories, two key challenges are posed for robots to emulate human performance. The first challenge is to reason about human intention given the observation history of pedestrian motion. The second challenge is to build a generative model that captures social norms and takes full advantage of intention information.
