Pedestrians trajectories prediction has become a popular topic in recent years. Many approaches can be used to accomplish the prediction, including deterministic and non-deterministic ways. In this report we conduct research and discuss how to use a non-deterministic method, i.e. deep learning methods to solve the prediction problem. The algorithm we are going to use is a combination of SocialGAN and InfoGAN. Firstly, we train a model by the adopted algorithms. Secondly, we generate trajectory pictures of some samples by the model. Then we observe the trajectories of different latent code values and disentangle one factor from the code, which is the direction of the pedestrian.
