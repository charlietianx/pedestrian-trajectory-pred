Pedestrians trajectories prediction has become a popular topic in recent years. Many approaches can be used to accomplish the prediction, including deterministic and non-deterministic ways. In this report we conduct research and discuss how to use a non-deterministic method, i.e. deep learning methods to solve the prediction problem. The algorithm we are going to use is a combination of SocialGAN and InfoGAN. Firstly, we train a model by the adopted algorithms. Secondly, during the research, we propose our research questions and try to answer them in the report.
